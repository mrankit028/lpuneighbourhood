## 🎯 Project Overview

NeighborFit addresses the critical problem of **information asymmetry** and **cognitive overload** in neighborhood selection through a sophisticated, data-driven matching algorithm. Built within academic constraints (zero budget, 2-week timeline), this application demonstrates systematic problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

**The Challenge**: Finding the right neighborhood involves processing vast amounts of scattered data across multiple sources - crime statistics, walkability scores, demographic data, cost of living, and local amenities. Traditional approaches lead to decision paralysis and suboptimal choices.

**Our Solution**: A personalized matching algorithm that processes real neighborhood data and provides ranked recommendations based on individual lifestyle preferences and priorities.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for full-stack development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and enhanced developer experience  
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for responsive, accessible design
- **Client-side state management** for user preferences

### Backend & Data Processing
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless data processing
- **Multi-source data integration** (Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap, Walk Score)
- **PostgreSQL schema** for scalable data storage
- **Python analytics pipeline** for validation and insights

### Algorithm Design
\`\`\`typescript
// Core matching algorithm
Score = Σ(Factor_i × Weight_i × User_Preference_i × Lifestyle_Multiplier_i)

// Where factors include:
// - Walkability, Safety, Affordability
// - Nightlife, Family-friendliness, Transit access
\`\`\`

## 📊 Research Methodology

### User Research (n=25)

- Identified gaps in personalization and data integration
- Analyzed user feedback and feature limitations

### Data Validation
- **Cross-referenced multiple sources** for accuracy
- **Algorithm validation** through user feedback simulation
- **A/B tested** different weighting methodologies

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📈 Data Integration
- **Real-time API integration** with multiple data sources
- **Comprehensive metrics**: walkability, safety, cost, amenities
- **Demographic analysis**: age, income, population density
- **Transportation data**: transit scores, bike lanes, commute times
