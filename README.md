## üéØ Project Overview

NeighborFit addresses the critical problem of **information asymmetry** and **cognitive overload** in neighborhood selection through a sophisticated, data-driven matching algorithm. Built within academic constraints (zero budget, 2-week timeline), this application demonstrates systematic problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

### üîç Problem Statement

**The Challenge**: Finding the right neighborhood involves processing vast amounts of scattered data across multiple sources - crime statistics, walkability scores, demographic data, cost of living, and local amenities. Traditional approaches lead to decision paralysis and suboptimal choices.

**Our Solution**: A personalized matching algorithm that processes real neighborhood data and provides ranked recommendations based on individual lifestyle preferences and priorities.

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for full-stack development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and enhanced developer experience  
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for responsive, accessible design
- **Client-side state management** for user preferences

### Backend & Data Processing
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless data processing
- **Multi-source data integration** (Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap, Walk Score)
- **PostgreSQL schema** for scalable data storage
- **Python analytics pipeline** for validation and insights

### Algorithm Design
\`\`\`typescript
// Core matching algorithm
Score = Œ£(Factor_i √ó Weight_i √ó User_Preference_i √ó Lifestyle_Multiplier_i)

// Where factors include:
// - Walkability, Safety, Affordability
// - Nightlife, Family-friendliness, Transit access
\`\`\`

## üìä Research Methodology

### User Research (n=25)
- **Semi-structured interviews** with recent movers

- **Preference validation** through survey data

### Competitive Analysis
- Evaluated 8 existing solutions (Zillow, Niche, AreaVibes, etc.)
- Identified gaps in personalization and data integration
- Analyzed user feedback and feature limitations

### Data Validation
